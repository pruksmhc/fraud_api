First pass: 
Neural netowrk, iwth all features in one network. 

Way of representing data -> need to turn it into numeic inputs. 
Current inputs: 
SRSSequence, Snapshots, 
-Number of seats in SRS 
-Frequency of each seta in SRS
Same for snapshots

Pad all 0s until it reaches the longest one. 

Current progress:
-Trying neural net 1 - needs tweaking, need to increase sensitivity for cases when there 9
update: 
-Now, neurl netowrk has 100% accuracy for predicting a banned person, and 81% accuracy for predicting 
when a pesron is not banned. 

TODO:
-Add numbers for Faebook data
